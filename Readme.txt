CODE SEARCH PLUG-IN DESCRIPTION
=============================
The Code Search plug-in will aid the developer to search for the required code snippets using code search engines, 
when writing code using Eclipse IDE. It will also enable the developer to manage and create his code repository in 
his system. From this code repository, the developer can fetch the required snippets and use them in his source 
code whenever required. This tool will use the existing code search engines available in the market to provide the 
integrated code search feature in the IDE.

Searching Code Snippets:

1.The user can choose simultaneously search the web and his own repository to search query for a code snippet.
2.The user can enter the keywords directly in the text box provided of each view. 
3. If the user is working in the code window, he can enter search query by highlighting the part of code and 
choose to send it to any of the two views. After highlighting, the user needs to choose to send to a view of his
choice under CodeSearch options of right click menu.
4.For searching web, the user needs to select a search engine from the provided options to display the 
corresponding results. The user may copy the code snippets to his code window and save for further use. 
5.The user also has a choice to search for the recently saved snippets in the repository, by clicking on the "Show
Recent" button

Storing Code Snippets:

1.Copy the code snippet to the Store Snippets text area present in the Search Repository view.
2.Provide the title in the title text box provided.
3.Tags are auto-suggested by the plug-in. The user can add user specific tags to enable easier retrieval.
4.Select the save option provided in the search repository after providing all the above mentioned mandatory 
fields.
5.Successful save message would pop up once the snippet is saved to the repository.
6.In order to check whether the code snippet is saved successfully to the repository,the developer can search for 
the stored code snippet in the repository by entering the tag of the code snippet. Based on the tag name, the 
search results are fetched in the Search Snippets section of the Search Repository view.
   
Managing Code Snippets:

1.The developer can also manage the code snippets stored in the repository by appending some lines of code to the 
existing code snippet or deleting the entire snippet.
2.Enter the tag name of the code snippet in the keyword text box of the search repository section.
3.Clicking the search button will fetch all the relevant tag names in the below text box.
